The contents of the file `/AICryptoPredictor/AICryptoPredictor/data/btcusd_1-min_data.csv` are not provided in your request. However, I can create a sample CSV structure that you might expect for historical Bitcoin price data. Here is a basic example of what the contents could look like:

Timestamp,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
1617235200,58000,58500,57500,58000,1000
1617235260,58000,58100,57900,58050,1500
1617235320,58050,58200,57800,58100,1200
1617235380,58100,58300,58000,58200,1300
1617235440,58200,58400,57950,58050,1100
1617235500,58050,58150,57850,57900,900
1617235560,57900,58000,57700,57800,800
1617235620,57800,57900,57600,57750,950
1617235680,57750,57850,57550,57700,1000
1617235740,57700,57900,57650,57850,1200

This is a simplified version of what the historical Bitcoin price data might look like, with timestamps in Unix format and corresponding open, high, low, close prices, and volume. You can adjust the data as needed for your specific use case.
