# AICryptoPredictor

AICryptoPredictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting Bitcoin price movements using historical data. The project utilizes TensorFlow to build and train a neural network model, which is then adapted for deployment on mobile and edge devices using TensorFlow Lite.

## Files Overview

- **notebooks/pipeline2.py**: This script contains the complete pipeline for training a neural network model. It includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model definition, training, evaluation, and saving predictions.

- **notebooks/pipeline7.py**: This script adapts the original pipeline for TensorFlow Lite, enabling the trained model to be converted into a format suitable for mobile and edge device deployment.

- **data/btcusd_1-min_data.csv**: This CSV file contains the historical price data for Bitcoin, which is used for training and testing the model.

- **Output/signal.txt**: This text file stores the final prediction signal generated by the model, indicating whether the price is expected to rise or fall.

- **results**: This directory is designated for storing the results of model predictions and evaluation reports.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the necessary dependencies for the project, including TensorFlow and any other libraries required for the implementation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure that you have the necessary data file (`btcusd_1-min_data.csv`) in the `data` directory.

## Usage Guidelines

- To train the model, run the `pipeline2.py` script. This will preprocess the data, train the neural network, and save the predictions.
- To convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format, run the `pipeline7.py` script.
- Check the `Output/signal.txt` file for the final prediction signal after running the training pipeline.
